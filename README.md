# ASReview-Work-Summer-2021
This encompasses all the work I did from May 2021 - August 2021 working with ASReview

ASReview is a A.I. assisted systematic review software maintained on GitHub. The work I did this summer was for an RA team evaluating how useful ASReview would be with their datasets, as well as trying combinations of query strategies to optimize the simulations I ran on these datasets. The datasets are not available for public view as they are protected under privacy policies.
